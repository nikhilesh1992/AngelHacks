Dhoom3 is not original amir khan - no way close to his performance of Ghazni or Lagaan - guess the story has overtones of many movies

being hrithik and aamir's fan hated both krrish3 and dhoom3.. but both are perfectionist they will be back in not time :)

yr's dumbest movies are zanjeer and krrish 3, dumber movies are naayak and chennai express, dumb movies are dhoom3, AD. #Dumbdumberdumbest

I hate #Dhoom3.

#Dhoom3 was even badmazing. It was just bad.

RT @AmyAwais: I'm sorry but there's only one Indian dude that looks good on a bike and that's John Abraham! #lame #dhoom3

Behter he #Dhoom3 pe paise xaya karne ke bajaye download kar ke dekh li jaye. worst reviews bout stupid actions in #Dhoom3

RT @ShaleenHarlalka: #Dhoom3 breaking new ground in senseless in Bollywood. Music 2/5 SFX 1/5 Plot 0/5.

Amazing cinematography and art direction wasted on joke of a plot. #Dhoom3

Really getting bored watching abhi n uday's fight with ghunda logs. Not needed sedha aamir ki story pe jao na. #DHOOM3

Ye uday chopra is really annoying #DHOOM3 abhishek's rikshaw fight bekaar not needed.

Worst part of #Dhoom3 was that it did not have even a single theft sequence, like #Dhoom2....which was a brilliant one featuring Hrithik..!!

#Dhoom3 on the other side, lures you with lots of expectations....and leaves you with utter disappointment....

Dhoom 3 is dissapointing. Great act by Amir Khan though and Katrina is hot üòç #Dhoom3

@udaychopra why did u even act ? u could have easily saved ur grace by quitting movies terrible isnt even a fair word to describe #Dhoom3

@aamir_khan Dhoom3 is awful waste of time and money i didn't expected from you atleast.....
